<h1 align="center"> satRday Code of Conduct</h1>
<h2>Short Version</h2>

<p>satRday is dedicated to a harassment-free and enjoyable conference experience for all participants.</p>

<h2>Medium Version</h2>

<p>satRday is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive conference experience for all in attendance regardless of, but not limited to, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, physical attributes, age, ethnicity, social standing, religion or political affiliation. We do not tolerate harassment of participants (including organisers and vendors) in any form. Sexual innuendos and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including presentations.</p>

<p>Anyone violating these rules may be given warning or expelled from the conference (without a refund) at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

<h2>Long Version</h2>

<p>This code of conduct applies to all satRdays spaces both online and offline. Our events are intended to be accessible and welcoming to a diverse audience. We prioritise low cost access to great information and we do our best to ensure our events support learning in a safe environment.</p>

<p>Please note, all in attendance of satRday, including guests, organisers, sponsors, volunteers and exhibitors in the expo hall or vendor booths are also subject to the code of conduct and from here on shall be referred to as "participants".</p>

<p>satRday is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive conference experience for all in attendance regardless of, but not limited to, gender, sexual orientation, employment, disabilities, physical attributes, age, ethnicity, social standing, religion or political affiliation. Harassment of conference participants in any form will not  be tolerated. Sexual innuendos and imagery are deemed inappropriate for any conference activities.</p>

<p>Violation of these rules may result in expulsion from the conference (without a refund, when relevant) at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Discrimination based on any of the above personal attributes.</li>
 	<li>Sexual images in public spaces.</li>
	<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following.</li>
	<li>Harassing photography or recording.</li>
	<li>Serious disruptions of presentations.</li>
	<li>Inappropriate physical contact.</li>
	<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
	<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.</li>
	<li>Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviour during any point of the satRday event.</li>
	<li>Threats of violence.</li>
</ul>

<p>SatRday prioritises marginalised people's safety over privileged people's comfort. Consequently, the organisers will not act on complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>
	<li> Reversisms including "reverse racism" and "reverse sexism".</li>
	<li> Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone", "go away" or "I'm not discussing this with you".</li>
	<li>Communicating in a tone you don't find congenial.</li>
	<li>Criticising racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Presenters, sponsors and vendors should not use sexualised images or language. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take action to keep the event a welcoming environment for all involved. This includes warning the offender or expulsion.</p>

<p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all times.</p>

<h3>Reporting</h3>

<p>Harassment or other violation of the code of conduct reduces the value and enjoyment of our event for everyone.</p>

<p>If you or anyone else is made to feel unsafe, unwelcome or disrespected, please report this to a conference staff member as soon as possible. Reports can be made personally or anonymously (see below).</p>

<p>Information to include in a written anonymous or personal report (ie. to the relevant event <a href="#personnel">personnel</a>.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identifying information of victim and perpetrator.</li>
	<li>Actions deemed in violation of the Code of conduct.</li>
	<li>Approximate time of the violation.</li>
	<li>Surrounding circumstances of incident.</li>
	<li>Your identity (unless you wish to remain anonymous).</li>
	<li>Identifying information of other parties involved (eg. fellow eye witness).</li>
</ul>


<h4>Anonymous Report</h4>

<p>If you are being harassed, have seen or heard of another participant being harassed or have any other related queries please contact one of the following conference personnel:</p>

<ul id="personnel">
	<li>Tess Korthout:  </li>
	<li>Roel Hogervorst: 06 27 527 923</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively you can  <a href="mailto:leadership@satrdays.org?subject=harassment">contact the Global Leadership Team via leadership@satrdays.org </a> .<p>

<h4>Personal Report</h4>

<p>Personal reports can be made by contacting a nearby staff member.</p>

<p>During the reporting process our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be heard. Another member of staff may occasionally be necessary to ensure the report is dealt with correctly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us what happened. We understand this may be upsetting and assure you we will deal with it as respectfully as possible. You also will not be required to confront the perpetrator and your identity will not be shared with them either.</p>

</p>If you still feel threatened our team members will be more than happy to help you contact venue security or local law enforcement or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the remainder of the event. We value your participation and your security is of great importance.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to satRdays spaces, but if you are being harassed outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment seriously. The satRday Team reserves the right to exclude people from future satRday events based on their past behavior at relevant events.</p>

<p>At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of satRdays members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>


<h2>Internal Version</h2>



<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>A member of staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant if their behaviour violates the Code of Conduct. Warnings should also be forwarded to the relevant organiser as soon as is practical. The report should include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identifying information of victim and perpetrator.</li>
	<li>Time the warning was issued.</li>
	<li>Actions deemed in violation of the Code of conduct.</li>
	<li>Approximate time of the violation (if different from the time of warning).</li>
	<li>Identifying information of other parties involved (eg. if assistance from fellow staff was required/if victim was accompanied by another eye witness).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Presentations</h3>

<p>Presentations should not be stopped for a one-time assumable error, though a staff member should speak to the presenter afterward. In the event that the code of conduct is continuously/seriously disregarded, staff should take immediate action to politely and professionally stop the presentation as soon as deemed necessary. For example, by simply saying "I apologize for the disruption but this presentation cannot be continued at this time."</p>


<h3>Taking Reports</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Record what is being said.</li>
	<li>Assure them they are being taken seriously and the violating action is intolerable.</li>
	<li>Ask for the relevant info listed in the above sub heading titled "Warnings" but not push for information if they seem visibly uncomfortable or otherwise reluctant.</li>
	<li>All reports must be recorded and passed along to the appropriate person.</li>
	<li>If requested by the reporter further action may be taken (eg. contact of organiser/law enforcement).</li>
	<li>Do not pressure the reporter to take further action if they don't want to but also mention means of action that can be taken (such as escort etc).</li>
	<li>Don't share unnecessary details of the report with others.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expulsion</h3>

<p>Reasons for possible expulsion:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A series of offences resulting in a warning from staff.</li>
	<li>Continuation of harassment after being instructed to stop.</li>
	<li>A single serious offense (eg. punching/groping).</li>
</ul>

<p>Consult with other staff members regarding incidents when possible but also act when necessary.<p>
